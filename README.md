# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub

Hi, I am a young programmer that is still within the first year of learning a few languages, but I am focusing on Python right now. Right now, I am working on a Codecademy Capstone project based on Machine Learning. The data comes from OkCupid and is my biggest, most complex project to date. I would appreciate it any advice here as I do not want to get stuck in tutorial purgatory. Thanks and happy to be part of the coding community.
